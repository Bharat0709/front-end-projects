          <strong> HyperText Markup Language </strong>, allows web users to
          create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements,
          tags, and attributes. However, it's worth noting that HTML is not
          considered a programming language as it can't create dynamic
          functionality. HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Web development :</strong> Developers use HTML code to design
          how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks,
          and media files.<br />
          <strong> Internet navigation :</strong> Users can easily navigate and
          insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily
          used to embed hyperlinks.<br />
          <strong> Web documentation :</strong> HTML makes it possible to
          organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
        </p>

        <P>
          It's also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web
          standard. The ,<strong>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </strong
          >maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing
          regular updates. This article will go over the basics of HTML,
          including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS
          and JavaScript.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
          In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
          prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
          documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
          Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote
          the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
          and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
          request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
          In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in
          which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first. The first
          publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
          Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
          1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
          simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were
          strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
          Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of
          these elements still exist in HTML4.

          HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added
          capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>

          <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>

          <p>
          <strong>January 14, 1997</strong><br />
          HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
          version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF
          had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16] Initially
          code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
          reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted
          most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and
          Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement
          between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas
          similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in
          MathML.

          <h4>HTML 4</h4>
          <p>
          <strong>December 18, 1997</strong><br />
          HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three
          variations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
          <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
          <li>
            Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many
          browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time
          sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them
          as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application
          conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
        </p>

        <P>
        <strong>April 24, 1998</strong><BR>
          HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the
          version number.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>December 24, 1999</strong><BR>
          HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the
          same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published
          on May 12, 2001.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>May 2000</strong><BR>
        
          ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was
          published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this
          standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint
          Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and
          processing languages).[22]= After HTML 4.01, there was no new version
          of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based
          language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early
          and mid-2000s.

        <strong>Html  5</strong> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
